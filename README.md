# Market Segmentation of Shopping Centre Visitors based on WiFi Tracking Data
General Assembly Data Science Project

## Overview

This project seeks to segment shopping centre visitors based on tracking their mobile device via the shopping centre's WiFi network. This is an unsupervised learning problem based on clustering techniques.

## Background

Shopping centres are real estate owners which generate revenue from retailers (tenants) in terms of leases on physical space within the centre. Leases generally comprise a fixed rental over the tenancy plus additional payments if the tenant exceeds an agreed revenue target. 

The focus of the shopping centre marketing team is to attract more shoppers to the centre and encourage them to spend more money with the retailers. This involves Above The Line (ATL) marketing such as TV, print and radio advertising as well as Below The Line (BTL) marketing to individual shoppers via Email Direct Marketing (EDM) campaigns.

Once shoppers are in the centre, they are encouraged to stay longer (dwell) and spend more via a number of means including:
- Ensuring the tenant mix is appropriate to meet shopper needs e.g. groceries plus fashion plus consumer electronics.
- Providing other services such as food and beverage outlets, entertainment options (cinemas) and children's play areas
- Offering WiFi hotspots to allow shoppers to easily connected to the internet

One of the main challenges for shopping centre marketing staff is not really understanding who shoppers are and why they may be visiting the centre. Since they don't have a direct transactional relationship with shoppers (compared with retailers), establishing loyalty programs such as FlyBuys or Everyday Rewards is not really feasible.
